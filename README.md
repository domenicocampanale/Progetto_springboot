# Spring Boot Application with MySQL Database and MVC Frontend

This application is built using Spring Boot and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. It connects to a MySQL database for data storage and uses an HTML page with JavaScript that shows the entire list of books. The application allows for basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the backend, while the frontend provides an interactive interface to display and manipulate the data.

Technologies Used:
Spring Boot for the backend.
MySQL for the database.
Thymeleaf as the template engine for the frontend.
JavaScript for adding dynamic functionality to the HTML page.
Spring Data JPA for interacting with the database.
Log4j2 for logging throughout the code
